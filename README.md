# Six Cards Under
Delve into an endless dungeon full of undead, demons, and necromancy in this retro dungeon crawler & deck builder hybrid. Six Cards Under is a take on the classic 90s dungeon crawlers with raycast rendering, turn-based combat, and plenty of enemies to burn down. Pick six cards in a drafting system to build your deck, then jump into the depths of the dungeon to see how many floors you can descend each run. Enemies only get harder the deeper you go, but there are a fair amount of pick-ups along the way to keep you alive.


## About the project:

Six Cards Under was a game made for the 10-day Pixel Game Jam 2025 with a heavy focus on pixel art. No game engine was used in the making of this game, just Blazor Web Assembly and HTML 2D Canvas.  The game uses a raycasting first-person shooter algorithm for scene rendering, and features grid-based movement with turn-based combat. Players draft their deck and use their chosen cards to defeat enemies and progress through an infinite dungeon.
